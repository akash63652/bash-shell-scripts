Bash shell scripting supports various types of operators, which are used for performing different operations such as arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and string manipulation. Here are the types of operators commonly used in Bash shell scripting:

Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
** (Exponentiation)
#Comparison Operators:

-eq (Equal to)
-ne (Not equal to)
-gt (Greater than)
-lt (Less than)
-ge (Greater than or equal to)
-le (Less than or equal to)


Logical Operators:
&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)


Assignment Operators:
 = (Simple assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
String Operators:

= (Equality)
!= (Inequality)
-z (Check if string is empty)
-n (Check if string is not empty)
> (Greater than, in ASCII order)
< (Less than, in ASCII order)
File Test Operators:

-e (Check if file exists)
-f (Check if file is a regular file)
-d (Check if file is a directory)
-r (Check if file is readable)
-w (Check if file is writable)
-x (Check if file is executable)
Bitwise Operators:

& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
These operators can be used in conditional statements (if, elif, while, for), arithmetic operations, string manipulation, file tests, and more, allowing you to perform a wide range of tasks in Bash shell scripting.

echo -e == using for the skip one line

set -x (Check the syntax of script code)
set -e (stop the script wher error found in script code)
